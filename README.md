# Hackathon-TunaMelt2018
This repo is for a 2018 hackathon at UTD.
The purpose of our project is to do as follows:
1: Given an image (with set maximum size), sort the pixels of the image by color and isolate groups of like pixels.
2: While sorting, compile in progress screenshots to composite a single animated video.
3: After sorting, scramble pixels randomly to generate new art.

This will be primarily done through Javascript (libraries are as of yet undecided). 
With luck, images will be passed through a basic website interface
